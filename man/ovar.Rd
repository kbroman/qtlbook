\title{Interspecific backcross in Drosophila}

\description{ 
  Data on ovariole number in a backcross between \emph{D. simulans} and
  \emph{D. sechellia}; the majority of individuals were selected to be
  recombinant in the region of a putative QTL on chromosome 3. 
}  

\usage{data(ovar)}

\format{
  An object of class \code{cross}.  See \code{\link[qtl]{read.cross}}
  for details.

\details{
  The data come from an interspecific Drosophila backcross.  
  \emph{D. simulans} was crossed to \emph{D. sechellia}, and the
  \eqn{F_1}{F1} hybrid was crossed back to \emph{D. simulans}.  

  The phenotype of interest was ovariole number in females (a measure of
  fitness).  Phenotypes \code{on1} and \code{on2} are the ovariole
  counts in the left and right gonads.  The phenotype \code{onm} is the
  average of the two counts; for many individuals, the ovariole count
  for one of two gonads was missing, and so \code{onm} is missing.

  In an initial cross of 402 individuals, 383 had complete phenotype
  data.  Initial genotyping focused on 94 individuals with extreme
  phenotype. 

  To increase the resolution of a major QTL identified on chromosome 3,
  a second cross of approximately 7000 flies was performed, though only
  1050 individuals showing a recombination event between two
  morphological markers, \emph{st} (bright red eyes) and \emph{e} (dark
  brown body), were phenotyped and genotyped; 1038 had complete
  phenotype data.  The aim was to oversample recombinants of the region
  of the QTL.  

  There are genotype data for 24 markers on 3 chromosomes.  (The fourth
  chromosome had one marker, but showed no effect and is not included in
  these data.)  

  The phenotype \code{cross} indicates whether an individual came from
  the first or second cross.

  Alleles \code{"I"} and \code{"E"} refer to \emph{D. simulans} and
  \emph{D. sechellia}, respectively.
