\description{
Data on ovariole number in a backcross between \emph{D. simulans} and
\emph{D. sechellia}; the majority of individuals were selected to be
recombinant in the region of a putative QTL on chromosome 3.
}
\details{
The data come from an interspecific Drosophila backcross.  \emph{D.
simulans} was crossed to \emph{D. sechellia}, and the \eqn{F_1}{F1} hybrid
was crossed back to \emph{D. simulans}.

The phenotype of interest was ovariole number in females (a measure of
fitness).  Phenotypes \code{on1} and \code{on2} are the ovariole counts in
the left and right gonads.  The phenotype \code{onm} is the average of the
two counts; for many individuals, the ovariole count for one of two gonads
was missing, and so \code{onm} is missing.

In an initial cross of 402 individuals, 383 had complete phenotype data.
Initial genotyping focused on 94 individuals with extreme phenotype.

To increase the resolution of a major QTL identified on chromosome 3, a
second cross of approximately 7000 flies was performed, though only 1050
individuals showing a recombination event between two morphological markers,
\emph{st} (bright red eyes) and \emph{e} (dark brown body), were phenotyped
and genotyped; 1038 had complete phenotype data.  The aim was to oversample
recombinants of the region of the QTL.

There are genotype data for 24 markers on 3 chromosomes.  (The fourth
chromosome had one marker, but showed no effect and is not included in these
data.)

The phenotype \code{cross} indicates whether an individual came from the
first or second cross.

Alleles \code{"I"} and \code{"E"} refer to \emph{D. simulans} and \emph{D.
sechellia}, respectively.
