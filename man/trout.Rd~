\details{
  Doubled haploid individuals were produced from a cross between Oregon
  State University (OSU) and Clearwater (CW) river rainbow trout
  (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) clonal lines.  Eggs from one of
  eight outbred females, two from Troutlodge (TL) and six from Spokane
  (SP), were irradiated to destroy maternal nuclear DNA and fertilized
  with sperm from a single \eqn{F_1}{F1} male.  The first embryonic
  cleavage was blocked by heat shock to restore diploidy.  There are a
  total of 554 individuals, with between 8 and 168 individuals from each
  of the eight females.

  The primary phenotype is time to hatch (\code{tth}).  An additional
  "phenotype", \code{female}, indicates maternal cytoplasmic environment
  (the source of the egg).

  There are genotype data on 171 markers on 28 linkage groups.  
  The linkage groups are named as in Nichols et al. (2002), though 
  linkage group 21 has been split into linkage groups 21a and 21b and a
  pair of markers are assigned to linkage group "un", as they don't
  connect to any of the linkage groups in Nichols et al. (2002).

%  A possible source of confusion is that the linkage groups are given
%  different names in Nichols et al. (2007); the corresondence is as
%  follows: 
%  \tabular{cc}{
%    \bold{Linkage group} \tab \bold{Nichols et al.} \cr
%    9     \tab   OC-10 \cr
%    14    \tab   OC-14 \cr
%    15    \tab   OC-24 \cr
%    19    \tab   OC-9  \cr
%    21    \tab   OC-b  \cr
%    27    \tab   OC-8  \cr
%    }

  Note that the data have cross type \code{"dh"} (for doubled
  haploids); in R/qtl they are treated just like a backcross, except
  that genotypes are referred to as the homozygotes.
